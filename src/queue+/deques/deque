// deque (double-ended queue), the structure which pops from / pushes to either side with the same \mathcal{O}(1)O(1) performance.

// Deques are a generalization of stacks and queues (the name is pronounced deck and is short for double-ended queue). Deques support thread-safe, memory efficient appends and pops from either side of the deque with approximately the same O(1) performance in either direction.
