We use binary heap to implement our priority queue.

Binary heaps can have one of two formats: a Max Binary Heap or a Min Binary Heap

- All of the child nodes in a Max Binary Heap are smaller than their parent
- All of the child nodes in a Min Binary Heap are greater than their parent

Thereâ€™s a pattern that children and parent nodes follow in our heap array. Where any index of an array is n,
The index of the left child is 2n + 1
The index of the right child is 2n + 2
In order to derive the index of the parent of a child we use (n-1)/2 rounded down.
